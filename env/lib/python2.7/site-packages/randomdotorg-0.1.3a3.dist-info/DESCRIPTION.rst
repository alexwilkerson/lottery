randomdotorg.py is a python module to implement python's random number interface
by fetching data from random.org, which is is a true random number service
that generates randomness via atmospheric noise.

Example of use:

>>> r = randomdotorg.RandomDotOrg()
>>> r.get_quota() # method to get allowed bit quota for this ip
999171
>>> print r.randrange(2, 33, 3)
14

Methods supported by the standard library random module are supported, except
for save/load state and seeding which won't make sense for a true random number
generator.
